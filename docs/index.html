        <h3 align="middle">Overview</h3>
        <p>
            In this project, we expanded the scope of project 3-1 by incorporating additional BSDFs to simulate light interaction with various materials. For part 1, we simulated the physics in which light reflects and refracts when traveling through various materials such as glass and mirrors. In addition, we implemented a Microfacet model for the interaction between light and isotropic rough conductors. Additionally, importance sampling proved to be a useful technique for rendering microfacet materials without requiring excessive numbers of ray samples. Through this project, we gained a better understanding of BSDFs and of how light behaves when bouncing off different materials.

        <h3 align="middle">Part 1. Mirror and Glass Materials</h3>

        <!-- <p><b>

        <p>
            In this part, we utilized The Law of Reflection, Snell's Law, and the Schlick Approximation for the Fresnel Equations to simulated the reflection and refraction of light for mirror and glass materials. We list our observations for how incorporating each bounce of light introduces different visual effects to our rendered image:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>max_ray_depth = 0: Only light sources are visible. We can only see the light coming directly from the source to our viewpoint because we only trace 0-bounce rays.</li>
            <li>max_ray_depth = 1: Objects that are directly illuminated by light, such as the different-colored walls of our cube, are rendered. We can also see a patch of light on each sphere that directs light from the source to our viewpoint. Shadows of spheres are also shown. We observe that the patch of light on the transmissive sphere is noisier because we are using a probabilistic method for simulate partial reflection and refraction described by Fresnel Equations.</li>
            <li>max_ray_depth = 2: The mirror effect created by sphere on the left becomes visible showing how light bounces off the walls, reflects off the mirror sphere’s surface, and towards our viewpoint. We can see the shadow of the mirror sphere also reflecting onto its surface.</li>
            <li>max_ray_depth = 3: The transmissive effect created by the glass sphere on the right can be seen as we get the necessary bounce of light to simulate refraction of light traveling through the glass ball. Furthermore, there is a concentration of refracted rays on the ground below the transmissive sphere, resulting in a bright spot.</li>
            <li>max_ray_depth = 4: The glass sphere’s reflection in the mirror sphere is observed. We can also see the bright spot on the blue wall resulting from light reflecting off the mirror sphere, traveling through the glass sphere which concentrates light onto the blue wall. The rendered images for max_ray_depth = 5 and 100 have similar appearance.</li>
        </ul>

            Show a screenshot sequence of 4 images of scene `CBdragon_microfacet_au.dae` rendered with $\alpha$ set to 0.005, 0.05, 0.25 and 0.5. The other settings should be at least 128 samples per pixel and 1 samples per light. The number of bounces should be at least 5. Describe the differences between different images. Note that, to change the $\alpha$, just open the .dae file and search for `microfacet`.
        </b></p> -->
        <p>
            During this project stage, I implemented the microfacet material model, a BSDF, and an importance sampler, which enabled us to generate diverse metallic materials with non-smooth surface features. To accomplish this, I calculated the normal distribution function (NDF) and Fresnel term (F) for the microfacet material model while considering the material's alpha value, which determines its level of roughness. A lower alpha value produces a shinier appearance, while a higher alpha value creates a rougher look. The BSDF and importance sampler utilized the Beckmann Distribution to define the distribution of half-vectors for perfect specular reflection, which contains a roughness parameter α. By changing this parameter, the range of surface characteristics that can be achieved can be adjusted, as demonstrated in the series of rendered images of the golden dragon. The dragon's appearance varies from smooth and glossy to scratched metal, depending on the roughness parameter used.

            The renders shown were produced using a constant sampling rate of 128 samples per pixel, 5 bounces and one sample per light source. If the alpha value is increased, the object will have a rougher appearance and will appear less glossy or shiny.

            The renders presented in this example were created with a fixed sampling rate of 64 samples per pixel and one sample per light source. The left image was generated using cosine hemisphere sampling, which uniformly samples rays over a hemisphere. This method is ideal for sampling diffuse BRDFs, but since the dragon material is microfacet and not diffuse, it leads to a noisy image. On the other hand, the right image was created using importance sampling, which prioritizes the samples with a higher influence on the image. The image generated using importance sampling is significantly less noisy with the same number of samples.

            By utilizing empirical data tables containing information about the refractive index and extinction coefficient of various materials, it is possible to select the appropriate values of η and k for each RGB color channel's wavelength to estimate the material's Fresnel term. In the above images, I render two multifaceted bunnies, I set the roughness parameter α to 0.05 and utilized the optical properties of Calcium and Gold.
